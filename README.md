# R Template

> ðŸ’¡ This is a template for new RStudio projects.

It provides some configuration out of the box to make getting started and managing projects easier.

## What does this add?

- Automatically sets the working directory to the root so that data files can be imported relative to the project root.

## How to use

- Add any data files to the `data` directory
- Open `index.r`
- Write your code (make sure to leave the `source('init.r')` call at the top, everything else can be replaced)
